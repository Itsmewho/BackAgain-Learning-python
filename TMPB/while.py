# Make a while loop with smiley's


# With a for loop:

# for smiley in range(1, 11):
#     print("\U0001f600" * smiley)


# White a while loop

# time = 1
# while time < 11:
#     print(f"\U0001f600" * time)
#     time += 1

# A useles combiantion with a > Big-O

#         count += 1
#     print(smileys)
