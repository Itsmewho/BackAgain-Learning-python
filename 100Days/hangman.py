# Make a hangman game.

# Use a dict -> import the dict from another file.
# Give each word a hint as helpline.
# Give a second helpline. Show 2 letters, if not the last 2 letters of the word.
# Add difficulty levels.
# High score -> CRUD operations -> Remember player.
# Refactor the game-over condition so the game stops immediately when a player loses all lives or chooses to quit. (quit any time)

# Use the style of 'boiler plate'.
# Try to think about the comments, redundent code and readability.
