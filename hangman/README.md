# Use your own database from MongoDB to make this work!!!!!!!:

# Normal CRUD-Operaterations ( Can use the code provided for it)

# The dictionary's are in the data folder.

# .env has something like this: MONGO_URI = mongodb://localhost:5000/ -->> MONGO_DBNAME --> MONGO_DBSCORE

# ----- Make a hangman game. -----

# Use a dict -> import the dict from another file.

# Mabe use random.sample or secrets.choice instead of just random.choice?????

# Give each word a hint as helpline.

# Give a second helpline. Show 2 letters, if not the last 2 letters of the word.

# Add difficulty levels.

# High score -> CRUD operations -> Remember player.

# Show last highscore and player - use MONGODB lol

# Check for db collection to select difficulty -> check if choice is in db-collection --> else wrong input,....

# Give possiblity to check highscores. (Make it best of whatever 5? )

# Refactor the game-over condition so the game stops immediately when a player loses all lives or chooses to quit. (quit any time)

# Mabe add some ASCII art. Keep the ASCII and remove the input to keep terminal clean???????

# Use the style of 'boiler plate'.

# Try to use a good folder-system

# Try to think about the comments, redundent code and readability.
